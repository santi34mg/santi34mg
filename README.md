# Santiago Silvera

I'm a junior developer who enjoys building things from the ground up: web applications, compilers, game engines and developer tooling. I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to understand systems deeply. I care about performance, correctness and clarity and I'm always looking to learn by building.

### Projects

**SAID** (Sistema de Administración de Información Docente): A production web application built for the University of Montevideo to manage critical academic data. I handled both backend and frontend: Python + Flask + SQLAlchemy on the server side and a React + TypeScript UI for staff interaction and data visualization. I also worked on the CI/CD pipeline and dealt with Dockerization.

**Quantum Computing Internship**:  I interned at QuantumSouth investigating performance, cost and configuration analysis of quantum algorithms on IBM quantum computers.

**Game Engine**: a hobby project aimed at learning. Built in C, initially following OpenGL tutorials and now transitioning to Vulkan. I plan to incorporate Rust into the project in the future.

### Interests

Language and compiler design with a focus on control and ergonomics, low overhead abstractions, static analysis and efficient runtime systems. Also interested in web development, though I mostly focus on backend systems and infrastructure.

### Stack

C, Rust (learning), Python, TypeScript  
Neovim, tmux, Linux (Arch, btw), Git, Docker

I prefer working on low level systems but know when to leverage higher level abstractions.
